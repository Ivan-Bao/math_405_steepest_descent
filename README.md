Questions about the course should normally be posted on [PIAZZA](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/103731/external_tools/201?display=borderless) so that the entire group can benefit from the discussion. Please email the instructor only in exceptional circumstances, e.g. when an issue is clearly private. 

[[PIAZZA SIGNUP]](https://piazza.com/ubc.ca/winterterm12022/math4051012022w1)

* Classes are Monday, Wednesday, Friday 1000-1100, West Mall Swing Space  (SWNG) Rm 107  
* Office hours: Monday 1330-1430 and Wed 1100-1200, LSK 303 
* **Midterm: 28/10**

## General Notes 

* You must have access to a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) + [Julia](https://julialang.org) environment to complete the assignments. I will provide some instructions on how you can set this up on your private machines, but the recommended and supported way is via a Jupyter Hub server provided by the mathematics department.
* There is a very nice [online textbook written by Toby Driscoll, Fundamentals of Numerical Computation.](https://fncbook.github.io/fnc/frontmatter.html). Although we won't use this book directly the general content and style are similar to MATH 405/607E. Student who would like to get a rough idea what this course will be like can take a look.
* Note there is `dev` branch which we use to test assignments and course notes before releasing them on the `main` branch. You are welcome to look, but DO NOT complete any assignment that hasn't yet been released on the `main` branch!

The course "cover image" is the famous Matlab logo. It is the solution of a second-order partial differential boundary value problem on an L-shaped domain.

In the image above we see the numerical solution of an advection equation using an UNSTABLE numerical method. In this course we will learn to recognize and avoid such pitfalls.

We will learn how to construct "spectral methods" to obtain high-accuracy solutions of highly nonlinear PDEs in only a handful of lines of code. Above the Korteveg-deVries equation and below the Cahn-Hilliard equation (modelling phase separation of binary fluids)
